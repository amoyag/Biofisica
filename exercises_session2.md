# Biological Circuits Lab Exercises

## Exercise 1: Negative Auto-regulation Response Time
Play with the parameters of the negative auto-regulation circuit (`alpha`, `beta`, `K`, `n`) and compare it with the simple regulation system to understand:
1. How does changing the Hill coefficient (`n`) affect the response time?
2. What happens when you increase `beta_reg` while keeping other parameters constant?
3. How does the `K` value influence the steady state?
4. Compare the response times between auto-regulated and simple systems.

Record your observations about which system reaches steady state faster and under what conditions.

## Exercise 2: AND Feed-Forward Loop Signal Duration
Experiment with the AND FFL parameters to understand signal filtering:
1. Calculate the delay using different values of `alpha_Y` and `beta_Y`
2. Set `t_on` to different values around the calculated delay
3. Observe what happens to Z when the signal duration is:
   - Shorter than the calculated delay
   - Equal to the calculated delay
   - Longer than the calculated delay

## Exercise 3: OR Feed-Forward Loop Memory
Explore how the OR FFL maintains the output signal after the input is gone:
1. Try different combinations of `alpha_Y` and `beta_Y` to see how they affect persistence
2. Change `K_Y` to see how the threshold affects the memory duration
3. Compare the decay rates of X, Y, and Z

## Exercise 4: I1-FFL Output Patterns
Investigate how the I1-FFL generates different output patterns:
1. Compare weak repression (n=1.4) vs strong repression (n=8)
2. Adjust `K_Y` to see how it affects the pulse height and width
3. Change `alpha_Z` and `beta_Z` to modify the pulse characteristics
