The jupyter notebook I have uploaded is the handout for a computer lab session of the Biophysics course for Biochemistry undergraduate students. The students have to tinker with the code that simulate the dynamics of several biological circuits to resolve some exercises. After that, they will complete MCQ for evaluation.
I need you create these exercises that can be solved understanding the circuits and playin with the code, and after that give me 30 questions with 5 options each based on these exercises. The students don't know mych about python they will tweak the paparmeters of each simulation to understand the circuit. Do not ask about coding, make each exercise so it can be solved by playing with the parametes of the simulations.
