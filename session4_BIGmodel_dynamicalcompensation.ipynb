        "# THE $\\beta$IG MODEL OF GLUCOSE REGULATION\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "The $\\beta$IG ($\\beta$-cells, Insulin, Glucose) model refers to a mathematical or conceptual framework used to understand and simulate the regulation of glucose levels in the body, particularly in the context of diabetes research. This model typically focuses on three key components:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **$\\beta$-cells**: These are cells located in the pancreas that produce insulin. The model often includes mechanisms by which these cells sense blood glucose levels and respond accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Insulin**: This is a hormone produced by $\\beta$-cells that plays a crucial role in regulating blood glucose levels. Insulin facilitates the uptake of glucose by cells in the body, thereby reducing blood glucose levels. The model would typically simulate how insulin is secreted in response to blood glucose levels and how it affects glucose uptake.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Glucose**: This is the primary sugar found in the blood and is a major energy source for the body. The model would include how glucose levels change in response to various factors, including food intake, insulin levels, and other physiological processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The $\\beta$IG model is often used in the study of diabetes, a condition characterized by impaired insulin production (Type 1 diabetes) or insulin resistance (Type 2 diabetes). By simulating how changes in beta-cell function, insulin secretion, and glucose uptake affect overall glucose regulation, researchers can gain insights into the disease process and potential treatments.\n",
        "\n",
        "The specifics of the $\\beta$IG model can vary depending on the research or the specific aspects of glucose regulation being studied. It can range from relatively simple mathematical models to more complex simulations incorporating additional factors like glucagon (another hormone involved in glucose regulation), the role of the liver, and the impact of various medications.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insulin sensitivity\n",
        "Insulin sensitivity refers to how effectively the body's cells respond to insulin. It varies among individuals and can be influenced by various factors including genetics, lifestyle, and health conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Genetic Factors**: Genetic makeup can influence insulin sensitivity. Some people may be genetically predisposed to higher insulin sensitivity, while others may have a predisposition to insulin resistance.\n",
        "- **Lifestyle Factors**:\n",
        "   - **Diet**: High-calorie diets, especially those rich in sugars and saturated fats, can decrease insulin sensitivity.\n",
        "   - **Physical Activity**: Regular physical activity increases insulin sensitivity as muscles use more glucose for energy during and after exercise.\n",
        "   - **Body Weight**: Higher body fat, particularly visceral fat around the abdomen, is associated with decreased insulin sensitivity.\n",
        "- **Health Conditions**:\n",
        "   - **Type 2 Diabetes**: This condition is characterized by insulin resistance, where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin.\n",
        "   - **Metabolic Syndrome**: A cluster of conditions including high blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol levels, which are linked to reduced insulin sensitivity.\n",
        "   - **Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)**: Women with PCOS often experience insulin resistance.\n",
        "- **Age**: Insulin sensitivity generally decreases with age, partly due to loss of muscle mass and increased fat, especially if not countered with physical activity.\n",
        "- **Hormonal Changes**: Hormonal fluctuations, such as those during pregnancy, can affect insulin sensitivity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Improving insulin sensitivity can often be achieved through lifestyle changes such as diet modifications, increased physical activity, and weight loss. In some cases, medication may also be required to manage insulin sensitivity, especially in conditions like type 2 diabetes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this exercise, we aim you can put together your own analysis of the regulation of glucose levels using the $\\beta$IG model and understand how this model explains the resistance of glucose regulation to changes in insulin sensitivity."

        "### The $\\beta$IG model\n",
        "\n",
        "The Python code below implements the $\\beta$IG model, governed by a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describe how $\\beta$-cells, insulin and glucose change over time in response to physiological factors, such as meal intake.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Components of the Model:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Time-Dependent Meal Function**:\n",
        "   - This function models the intake of glucose from meals. It provides a temporary increase in glucose levels ($m$) at specific meal times ($meal_time$) for a given duration ($meal_duration$).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **ODEs for the BIG Model**:\n",
        "   - The system is described by three coupled differential equations representing the dynamics of glucose, insulin, and beta-cells.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Parameters:\n",
        "- $m = 20.0$: Glucose input from meals.\n",
        "- $s = 0.01$: Insulin sensitivity.\n",
        "- $gamma = 0.8$: Insulin degradation rate.\n",
        "- $mu = 0$: Growth rate of beta-cells, set to zero in this scenario, indicating a constant beta-cell population.\n",
        "- $meal\\_time = 1$: Time at which meal intake occurs.\n",
        "- $meal\\_duration = 0.15$: Duration of the meal's effect on glucose levels.\n",
        "- $I0 = 10$: Initial insulin level (ÂµU/mL).\n",
        "- $G0 = 5.0$: Initial glucose level, representing a typical fasting level (mM).\n",
        "- $B0 = 1.0$: Initial level of beta-cells.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### ODEs of the Dynamics:\n",
        "The model is described by the following differential equations:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Glucose Dynamics**:\n",
        "   $$ \\frac{dG}{dt} = \\text{current_m} - (s \\cdot I \\cdot G) $$\n",
        "   - $current\\_m$ is the glucose input from the meal, calculated by the $meal\\_input$ function.\n",
        "   - $s$ is the insulin sensitivity, and $I$ is the insulin level.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Insulin Dynamics**:\n",
        "   $$ \\frac{dI}{dt} =\n",
        "   \\begin{cases}\n",
        "   0, & \\text{if } t < \\text{meal_time} \\\\\n",
        "   B \\cdot f_G - \\gamma \\cdot I, & \\text{otherwise}\n",
        "   \\end{cases} $$\n",
        "   $f_G$ represents the insulin production rate, modeled as a function of glucose levels. Before the meal, insulin production is kept constant. It is modeled using a modified sigmoid function, $f(G) = \\frac{f_{\\text{max}}}{1 + e^{-K \\cdot G}}$.  Where $f_{\\text{max}}$ is the maximum insulin production rate, $K$ is a constant that determines the glucose level for the half-maximal effect, $G$ is the glucose level.\n",
        "\n",
        "This form of $f(G)$ provides a sigmoidal response to glucose levels, which is a common way to model the rate at which insulin is produced in response to changing glucose concentrations. The parameters $f_{\\text{max}}$ and $K$ can be adjusted to fit the specific characteristics of the insulin response curve for different physiological conditions. You can see the shape of $f(G)$ below."
