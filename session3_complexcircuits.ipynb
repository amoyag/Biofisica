        "## The feedback loop\n",
        "Biological circuits, much like their electronic counterparts, rely on complex networks of interactions to regulate and control various functions within living organisms. Central to these networks are feedback loops, which play a pivotal role in maintaining homeostasis, orchestrating developmental processes, and enabling adaptive responses to environmental changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Feedback loops in biological systems are mechanisms through which a system regulates its own behavior by responding to its own outputs. These loops can be broadly classified into two categories:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Positive Feedback Loops**: These amplify a signal or increase the output of a system.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Negative Feedback Loops**: These work to dampen or stabilize a system. ### Feedback Loops and Memory in Biological Systems\n",
        "\n",
        "Feedback loops in biological systems not only regulate immediate responses but also contribute to a form of cellular memory. This memory allows cells to remember and respond to past events, an essential feature for adaptation and survival in changing environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Biological memory, in this context, refers to the ability of a cell or a system to maintain a state or response over time, even after the initial stimulus that triggered the response has ceased. This capability is crucial for processes like development, immune responses, and learning in higher organisms.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Role of Feedback Loops in Memory\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Stabilizing Information**: Negative feedback loops are particularly important in stabilizing states within cells. Once a cell commits to a particular state (like becoming a specific cell type during development), negative feedback mechanisms can help lock the system into that state, making it resistant to minor fluctuations in environmental conditions or internal noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Maintaining States Over Time**: Positive feedback loops can maintain a response or a state over a prolonged period. Once triggered, a positive feedback loop can sustain its own activity, creating a lasting response until an external signal or a separate negative feedback loop intervenes. This is akin to a \"latch\" in electronics, where a switch, once flipped, stays in its new position.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Bistability**: Some systems exhibit bistability, where they can stably exist in one of two states. This is often achieved through interlinked positive and negative feedback loops. In such systems, the transition from one state to another requires a significant stimulus, but once the change is made, the system remembers this state, even if the stimulus is removed. This property is called hysteresis and is a powerful mechanism for cellular memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will simulate the dynamics of positive and negative feedback loops and explore their effect in memory."

        "We set up a positive feedback loop in which transcription factor X activates transcription factors $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ which mutually activate each other. The input function at the $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ promoters is an OR gate. At time t=0 X begins to produce from an initial concentration of X=0. Initially, $Y_1$ = $Y_2$ = 0. All production rates are beta = 1 and removal rates are alpha = 1. All of the activation thresholds are K = 0.5. At time = 3 production of X stops.\n",

        "To simulate this setting with ordinary differential equations, we need to define the ODEs for the concentrations of transcription factors X, $Y_1$, and $Y_2$ over time. The dynamics of the system are governed by the following principles:\n",

        "3. **Removal of X, $Y_1 $, and $Y_2 $**: Each factor is removed at a constant rate ($\\alpha = 1 $).\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the most fascinating aspects of biological systems is their ability to make clear, decisive choices between different states. The bacteriophage lambda, a virus that infects E. coli bacteria, provides a remarkable example of such decision-making at the molecular level. When lambda infects a bacterial cell, it must \"choose\" between two distinct lifestyles: the lytic pathway (where it immediately reproduces and kills the host cell) or the lysogenic pathway (where it integrates into the host genome and remains dormant).\n",
        "\n",
        "This decision is controlled by an elegant molecular circuit centered around two key proteins: CI (also known as λ repressor) and Cro. These proteins engage in a mutual antagonism —each protein represses the production of the other. This creates a biological \"toggle switch\" where typically only one protein can dominate at a time: high CI levels maintain the lysogenic state, while high Cro levels trigger the lytic pathway.\n",
        "\n",
        "What makes this system particularly interesting is its bistable nature. Like a light switch that can be either \"on\" or \"off\" but not in between, the lambda switch tends to settle into one of two stable states. This bistability arises from the mutual repression between CI and Cro, combined with cooperative binding (proteins binding as dimers) and carefully tuned protein production and degradation rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our simulation, we'll explore how this bistable switch operates by modeling the key molecular interactions as a system of differential equations. The model incorporates several important biological features:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Cooperative binding of proteins (represented by Hill coefficients)\n",
        "2. Mutual repression through operator binding\n",
        "3. Basal protein production (\"leaky\" expression)\n",
        "4. Protein degradation\n",
        "\n",
        "By adjusting parameters like protein production rates (β), degradation rates (α), binding constants (K), and initial conditions, we can investigate:\n",
        "- How small differences in initial protein levels can lead to dramatically different outcomes\n",
        "- The conditions required for maintaining bistability\n",
        "- The role of cooperative binding in creating switch-like behavior\n",
        "- How protein degradation affects the stability of each state\n",
        "\n",
        "This system serves as an excellent example of how relatively simple molecular interactions can create complex, switch-like behaviors essential for biological decision-making. Through our simulation, we'll gain insights into both the specific workings of the lambda switch and the general principles of biological bistability.\n",
