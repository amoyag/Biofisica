        "## The feedback loop\n",
        "Biological circuits, much like their electronic counterparts, rely on complex networks of interactions to regulate and control various functions within living organisms. Central to these networks are feedback loops, which play a pivotal role in maintaining homeostasis, orchestrating developmental processes, and enabling adaptive responses to environmental changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Feedback loops in biological systems are mechanisms through which a system regulates its own behavior by responding to its own outputs. These loops can be broadly classified into two categories:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Positive Feedback Loops**: These amplify a signal or increase the output of a system.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Negative Feedback Loops**: These work to dampen or stabilize a system. ### Feedback Loops and Memory in Biological Systems\n",
        "\n",
        "Feedback loops in biological systems not only regulate immediate responses but also contribute to a form of cellular memory. This memory allows cells to remember and respond to past events, an essential feature for adaptation and survival in changing environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Biological memory, in this context, refers to the ability of a cell or a system to maintain a state or response over time, even after the initial stimulus that triggered the response has ceased. This capability is crucial for processes like development, immune responses, and learning in higher organisms.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Role of Feedback Loops in Memory\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Stabilizing Information**: Negative feedback loops are particularly important in stabilizing states within cells. Once a cell commits to a particular state (like becoming a specific cell type during development), negative feedback mechanisms can help lock the system into that state, making it resistant to minor fluctuations in environmental conditions or internal noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Maintaining States Over Time**: Positive feedback loops can maintain a response or a state over a prolonged period. Once triggered, a positive feedback loop can sustain its own activity, creating a lasting response until an external signal or a separate negative feedback loop intervenes. This is akin to a \"latch\" in electronics, where a switch, once flipped, stays in its new position.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Bistability**: Some systems exhibit bistability, where they can stably exist in one of two states. This is often achieved through interlinked positive and negative feedback loops. In such systems, the transition from one state to another requires a significant stimulus, but once the change is made, the system remembers this state, even if the stimulus is removed. This property is called hysteresis and is a powerful mechanism for cellular memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will simulate the dynamics of positive and negative feedback loops and explore their effect in memory."
